UL4 -- A templating language
############################

:mod:`ll.ul4c` provides templating for XML/HTML as well as any other text-based
format. A template defines placeholders for data output and basic logic (like
loops and conditional blocks), that define how the final rendered output will
look.

:mod:`ll.ul4c` compiles a template to an internal format, which makes it
possible to implement renderers for these templates in multiple programming
languages.

Apart from this Python implementation there are implementations for Java_ (both
a compiler and renderer) and Javascript_ (renderer only).

Embedding
=========

In the template source any text surrounded by ``<?`` and ``?>`` is a "template
tag". The first word inside the tag is the tag type. It defines what the tag
does. For example ``<?print foo?>`` is a print tag (it prints the value of the
variable ``foo``). A complete example template looks like this::

	<?if data?>
		<ul>
			<?for item in data?>
				<li><?print xmlescape(item)?></li>
			<?end for?>
		</ul>
	<?end if?>

(For text formats where the delimiters ``<?`` and ``?>`` collide with elements
that are used often or where using these delimiters is inconvenient it's
possible to specify a different delimiter pair when compiling the template.)

A complete Python program that compiles a template and renders it might look
like this::

	from ll import ul4c

	code = '''
		<?if data?>
			<ul>
				<?for item in data?>
					<li><?print item?></li>
				<?end for?>
			</ul>
		<?end if?>
	'''

	template = ul4c.Template(code)

	print(template.renders(data=["Python", "Java", "Javascript", "PHP"]))

The variables that should be available to the template code can be passed to the
method :meth:`~ll.ul4c.Template.renders` as keyword arguments.
:meth:`~ll.ul4c.Template.renders` returns the final rendered output as a string.
Alternatively the method :meth:`~ll.ul4c.Template.render` can be used, which is
a generator and returns the output piecewise.


Builtin types
=============

The following object types can be created and used insided templates:

*	strings
*	integers
*	floats
*	date objects
*	color objects
*	The "null" value (``None``)
*	boolean values (``True`` and ``False``)
*	lists
*	dictionaries
*	UL4 templates

Note that depending on the implementation language of the renderer additional
types might be supported, e.g. a Python renderer will probably support both
tuples and lists and anything supporting :meth:`__getitem__` (or :meth:`__iter__`
when the list is used in a loop) for lists, Java might support anything
implementing the ``List`` interface (or the ``Collection`` interface if the list
is used in a loop).

Objects of these types can either be passed to the template in the call to the
render function, or the template can create objects of thoses types itself. The
syntax for creating such a constant is very similar to Python's syntax.


The "null" constant
-------------------

The "null" constant can be referred to via ``None``.


Boolean constants
-----------------

The boolean constants can be referred to via ``True`` and ``False``.


Integer constants
-----------------

Integer constants can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, octal and binary:
``42``, ``0x2a``, ``0o52`` and ``0b101010`` all refer to the integer value 42.


Float constants
---------------

Float constants must contain a decimal point or an exponential specifier,
e.g. ``42.``, ``4e23``.


String constants
----------------

Strings are delimited with single or double quotes and support all escape
sequences that Python supports (except ``\N{}``). Strings constants allow
``\uXXXX`` escaping. Examples:

* ``"abc"`` and ``'abc'``;

*	``"'"`` and ``'\''`` are single quotes;

*	``'"'`` and ``"\""`` are double quotes;

*	``"\n"`` is a line feed and ``"\t"`` is a tab;

*	``"\x61"`` and ``"\u0061"`` are lowercase "a"s;

Strings can also be delimited with triple single or double quotes like in Python.
These strings support embedded line feeds.


Date constants
--------------

Date objects have a date and time including microseconds. Date constants can be
created like this:

*	``@(2008-12-24)``

*	``@(2008-12-24T12:34)``

*	``@(2008-12-24T12:34:56)``

*	``@(2008-12-24T12:34:56.987654)``


Color constants
---------------

Color values are 8 bit red, green, blue and alpha values. Color constants can
be created like this:

*	``#fff``

*	``#fff8``

*	``#0063a8``

*	``#0063a880``

The variants with 3 or 6 hex digits will create a color object with an alpha
value of 255.


Lists
-----

Lists can be created like this:

*	``[]``

*	``[1, 2, 3]``

*	``[None, 42, "foo", [False, True]]``

``*`` expressions can be used to expand other lists inplace, so ::

	[1, *[2, 3], 4, *[5, 6]]

is equivalent to ::

	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

It is also possible to create a list with a list comprehension::

	["(" + c.upper() + ")" for c in "hurz" if c < "u"]

This will create the list ::

	["(H)", "(R)"]

The ``if`` condition is optional, i.e. ::

	["(" + c.upper() + ")" for c in "hurz"]

will create the list ::

	["(H)", "(U)", "(R)", "(Z)"]


Dictionaries
------------

Dictionaries can be created like this:

*	``{}``

*	``{1: 2, 3: 4}``

*	``{"foo": 17, "bar": 23}``

``**`` expressions can be used to expand other dictionaries inplace, so::

	{"foo": 17, **{"bar": 23, "baz": 42}}

is equivalent to ::

	{"foo": 17, "bar": 23, "baz": 42}

The ``**`` must be a dictonary or a list of key/value pairs.

It is also possible to create a dictionary with a dictionary comprehension::

	{ c.upper() : "(" + c + ")" for c in "hurz" if c < "u"}

This will create the dictionary ::

	{ "H": "(h)", "R": "(r)"}

The ``if`` condition is optional, i.e. ::

	{ c.upper() : "(" + c + ")" for c in "hurz"}

will create the dictionary ::

	{ "H": "(h)", "U": "(u)", "R": "(r)", "Z": "(z)"}


Sets
----

Sets can be created like this:

*	``{/}`` (this is the empty set)

*	``{1, 2, 3}``

*	``{"foo", "bar"}``

The empty set can also be created with the function ``set``::

	set()

``*`` expressions are also supported::

	{1, *[2, 3], 4, *[5, 6]}

It is also possible to create a set with a set comprehension::

	{c.upper() for c in "hurz" if c < "u"}

This will create the set ::

	{"H", "R"}

The ``if`` condition is optional, i.e. ::

	{c.upper() for c in "hurz"}

will create the dictionary ::

	{"H", "R", "U", "Z"}


The ``Undefined`` object
------------------------

The object ``Undefined`` will be returned when a non-existant variable, a
non-existant dictionary entry or an index that is out of range for a list/string
is accessed.


Template code
=============

The template code tries to mimic Python syntax as far as possible, but is
limited to what is required for templates and does not allow executing arbitrary
Python statements. In some spots it also borrows Javascript semantics.

:mod:`ll.ul4c` supports the following tag types:


``print``
---------

The ``print`` tag outputs the value of a variable or any other expression. If
the expression doesn't evaluate to a string it will be converted to a string
first. The format of the string depends on the renderer, but should follow
Python's ``str()`` output as much as possible::

	<h1><?print person.lastname?>, <?print person.firstname?></h1>

Printing ``None`` or undefined object produces no output.


``printx``
----------

The ``printx`` tag outputs the value of a variable or any other expression and
escapes the characters ``<``, ``>``, ``&``, ``'`` and ``"`` with the appropriate
character or entity references for XML or HTML output.


``for``
-------

The ``for`` tag can be used to loop over the items in a list, the characters in
a string or the keys in a dictionary. The end of the loop body must be marked
with an ``<?end for?>`` tag::

	<ul>
		<?for person in data.persons?>
			<li><?print person.lastname?>, <?person.firstname?></li>
		<?end for?>
	</ul>

In ``for`` loops variable unpacking is supported, so you can do the following::

	<?for (key, value) in dict.items()?>

if ``dict`` is a dictionary.

This unpacking can be arbitrarily nested, i.e. the following is possible too::

	<?for (i, (key, value)) in enumerate(dict.items())?>


``break``
---------

The ``break`` tag can be used to break out of the innermost running loop.


``continue``
------------

The ``continue`` tag can be used to skip the rest of the loop body of the
innermost running loop and continue with the next iteration of the loop.


``if``
------

The ``if`` tag can be used to output a part of the template only when a
condition is true. The end of the ``if`` block must be marked with an
``<?end if?>`` tag. The truth value of an object is mostly the same as in Python:

*	``None`` is false.
*	The integer ``0`` and the float value ``0.0`` are false.
*	Empty strings, lists and dictionaries are false.
*	``timedelta`` and ``monthdelta`` objects for an empty timespan (i.e.
	``timedelta(0, 0, 0)`` and ``monthdelta(0)``) are false.
*	``False`` is false.
*	``Undefined`` is false.
*	Anything else is true.

For example we can output the person list only if there are any persons::

	<?if persons?>
		<ul>
			<?for person in persons?>
				<li><?print person.lastname?>, <?person.firstname?></li>
			<?end for?>
		</ul>
	<?end if?>

``elif`` and ``else`` are supported too::

	<?if persons?>
		<ul>
			<?for person in persons?>
				<li><?print person.lastname?>, <?person.firstname?></li>
			<?end for?>
		</ul>
	<?else?>
		<p>No persons found!</p>
	<?end if?>

or::

	<?if len(persons)==0?>
		No persons found!
	<?elif len(persons)==1?>
		One person found!
	<?else?>
		<?print len(persons)?> persons found!
	<?end if?>


``code``
--------

The ``code`` tag can contain statements that define or modify variables or
expressions which will be evaluated for their side effects. Apart from the
assigment operator ``=``, the following augmented assignment operators are
supported:

*	``+=`` (adds a value to the variable)
*	``-=`` (subtracts a value from the variable)
*	``*=`` (multiplies the variable by a value)
*	``/=`` (divides the variable by a value)
*	``//=`` (divides the variable by a value, rounding down to the next
	smallest integer)
*	``&=`` (Does a modulo operation and replaces the variable value with the
	result)

For example the following template will output ``40``::

	<?code x = 17?>
	<?code x += 23?>
	<?print x?>


``render``
----------

The ``render`` tag allows one template to call other templates. The following
Python code demonstrates this::

	from ll import ul4c

	# Template 1
	source1 = """\
	<?if data?>\
	<ul>
	<?for i in data?><?render itemtmpl(item=i)?><?end for?>\
	</ul>
	<?end if?>\
	"""

	tmpl1 = ul4c.Template(source1)

	# Template 2
	source2 = "<li><?print xmlescape(item)?></li>\n"

	tmpl2 = ul4c.Template(source2)

	# Data object for the outer template
	data = ["Python", "Java", "Javascript", "PHP"]

	print(tmpl1.renders(itemtmpl=tmpl2, data=data))

This will output::

	<ul>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>Java</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	</ul>

I.e. templates can be passed just like any other object as a variable.
``<?render itemtmpl(item=i)?>`` renders the ``itemtmpl`` template and passes
the ``i`` variable, which will be available in the inner template under the
name ``item``.


``renderx``
-----------

The ``renderx`` tag works similar to the ``render`` tag, except that the output
of the template called will be XML escaped (like ``printx`` does). The following
Python code demonstrates this::

	from ll import ul4c

	# Template 1
	tmpl1 = ul4c.Template("<&>")

	# Template 2
	tmpl2 = ul4c.Template("<?renderx tmpl()?>\n")

	print(tmpl1.renders(tmpl=tmpl2))

This will output::

	&lt;&amp;&gt;


``def``
-------

The ``def`` tag defines a new template as a variable. Usage looks like this::

	<?def quote?>
		"<?print text?>"
	<?end def?>

This defines a local variable ``quote`` that is a template object. This template
can be rendered like any other template that has been passed to the outermost
template::

	<?render quote(text="foo")?>

It's also possible to include a signature in the definition of the template.
This makes it possible to define default values for template variables and to
call templates with positional arguments::

	<?def quote(text='foo')?>
		"<?print text?>"
	<?end def?>
	<?render quote()?> and <?render quote("bar")?>

This will output ``"foo" and "bar"``.

``*`` and ``**`` arguments are also supported::

	<?def weightedsum(*args)?>
		<?print sum(i*arg for (i, arg) in enumerate(args, 1))?>
	<?end def?>
	<?render weightedsum(17, 23, 42)?>

This will print ``189`` (i.e. ``1 * 17 + 2 * 23 + 3 * 42``).


``renderblocks``
----------------

The ``renderblocks`` tag is syntactic sugar for rendering a template and
passing other templates as arguments in the call. For example if we have the
following template::

	<?def page(head, body, lang="en", doctype=False)?>
		<?if doctype?>
			<!DOCTYPE html>
		<?end if?>
		<html lang="<?printx lang?>">
			<head>
				<?render head()?>
			</head>
			<body>
				<?render body()?>
			</body>
		</html>
	<?end def?>

then we can render this template in the following way::

	<?renderblocks page(lang="de", doctype=True)?>
		<?def head?>
			<title>Foo</title>
		<?end def?>
		<?def body?>
			<h1>Bar!</h1>
		<?end def?>
	<?end renderblocks?>

This is syntactic sugar for::

	<?def head?>
		<title>Foo</title>
	<?end def?>
	<?def body?>
		<h1>Bar!</h1>
	<?end def?>
	<?render page(lang="de", doctype=True, head=head, body=body)?>

In both cases the output will be::

	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="de">
		<head>
			<title>Foo</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>Bar!</h1>
		</body>
	</html>

All variables defined between ``<?renderblocks page(...)?>`` and
``<?end renderblocks?>`` are passed as additional keyword arguments in the
render call to ``page``. (But note that those variables will be local to the
``<?renderblocks?>`` block, i.e. they will not leak into the surrounding
code.)


``renderblock``
---------------

The ``renderblock`` is a special version of ``renderblocks``. The complete
content of the ``renderblock`` block will be wrapped in a signatureless template
named ``content`` and this template will be passed as the keyword argument
``content`` to the render call. With this we can define a generic template for
HTML links::

	<?def a(content, **attrs)?>
		<a<?for (an, av) in attrs.items()?> <?print an?>="<?printx av?>"<?end for?>>
			<?render content()?>
		</a>
	<?end def?>

and then use it like this::

	<?renderblock a(class="extern", href="http://www.python.org/")?>
		Link to the Python homepage
	<?end renderblock?>

The output will be::

	<a class="extern" href="http://www.python.org/">
		Link to the Python homepage
	</a>


``ul4``
-------

The ``ul4`` tag can be used to specify a name and a signature for the template
itself. This overwrites the name and signature specified in the
:class:`ul4c.Template` constructor::

	>>> from ll import ul4c
	>>> t = ul4c.Template("<?ul4 foo(x)?><?print x?>")
	>>> t.name
	'foo'
	>>> t.signature
	<Signature (x)>


``note``
--------

A ``note`` tag is a comment, i.e. the content of the tag will be completely
ignored.


``doc``
-------

A ``doc`` tag contains the documentation of the template itself. The content
of the ``<?doc?>`` tag is available as the ``doc`` attribute::

	>>> from ll import ul4c
	>>> t = ul4c.Template("<?doc foo?><?print x?>")
	>>> t.doc
	'foo'

Each ``<?doc?>`` contains the documentation for the template to which the
``<?doc?>`` tag belongs, i.e. if the ``<?doc?>`` tag is at the outermost
level, it belongs to the outermost template. If the ``<?doc?>`` tag is inside
a local template, it is the documentation for the local template. If multiple
``<?doc?>`` tags are given, only the first one will be used, all later ones will
be ignored.

Note that the template name, documentation and signature are accessible inside
the templates themselves, i.e. ::

	<?def f(x=17, y=23)?>
		<?doc return the sum of x and y?>
		<?return x+y?>
	<?end def?>
	<?print f.name?>
	<?print f.doc?>
	<?print f.signature?>

will output ::

	f
	return the sum of x and y
	(x=17, y=23)


``whitespace``
--------------
The ``whitespace`` tag can be used to overwrite the handling of whitespace in
the template. For more info see the chapter on whitespace handling at the end.


Nested scopes
-------------

UL4 templates support lexical scopes. This means that a template that is defined
(via ``<?def?>``) inside another template has access to the local variables
of the outer template. The inner template sees the state of the variables at
the point in time when the inner templates gets called. The following example
will output ``2``::

	<?code i = 1?>
	<?def x?>
		<?print i?>
	<?end def?>
	<?code i = 2?>
	<?render x()?>


Expressions
-----------

:mod:`ll.ul4c` supports many of the operators supported by Python. The following
subchapters describe all expression/operators that UL4 supports and are ordered
from highest precedence to lowest.


Generator expressions
"""""""""""""""""""""

UL4 supports generator expressions with look like list comprehensions without
the square brackets. Generator expression do not create lists in memory but
instead return an iterable that can be iterated once. Function and methods
that require an iterable argument can directly consume such iterables::

	<?print ", ".join("(" + c + ")" for c in "gurk")?>

will output::

	(g), (u), (r), (k)

Outside of function/method arguments (or when more that one argument is passed)
parentheses are required around generator expressions::

	<?code ge = ("(" + c + ")" for c in "gurk")?>
	<?print ", ".join(ge)?>


Index/slice access
""""""""""""""""""

Index and slice access is available for all container types, i.e. in the
expression ``a[b]`` the following type combinations are supported:

*	string, integer: Returns the ``b``\th character from the string ``a``.
	Note that negative ``b`` values are supported and are relative to the end,
	so ``a[-1]`` is the last character.

*	list, integer: Returns the ``b``\th list entry of the list ``a``. Negative
	``b`` values are supported too.

*	dict, string: Return the value from the dictionary ``a`` corresponding to
	the key ``b``. Note that some implementations might support keys other
	than strings too. (The Python and Java implementations do for example.
	The Javascript implementation does too, if ``Map`` is supported.)

If the specified key doesn't exist or the index is out of range for the string
or list, a special "undefined" object is returned.

Slices are also supported (for list and string objects). As in Python one or
both of the indexes may be missing to start at the first or end after the last
character/item. Negative indexes are relative to the end. Indexes that are out
of bounds are simply clipped:

*	``<?print "Hello, World!"[7:-1]?>`` prints ``World``.

*	``<?print "Hello, World!"[:-8]?>`` prints ``Hello``.


Attribute access
""""""""""""""""

For string keys it's also possible to access dictionary entries via the
attribute access operator ``.``, i.e. ``foo.key`` is the same as ``foo["key"]``
if ``foo`` is a dictionary.


Function calls
""""""""""""""

A function call in UL4 looks like this: ``date(2014, 10, 9, 17, 29)``.
(this returns the date object ``@(2014-10-09T17:29)``). Some of the trailing
arguments in a function call might be optional and have default values.
For example the first three arguments for the ``date`` function (``year``,
``month`` and ``day``) are required, the remaining four arguments (``hour``,
``minute``, ``second`` and ``microsecond``) are optional and default to ``0``.

Parameter values can also be passed via keyword arguments, i.e.
``date(2014, 10, 9)`` could also be written as
``date(day=9, month=10, year=2014)``.

Furthermore Python's ``*`` and ``**`` syntax is supported for passing additional
positional or keyword arguments. For example::

	<?code args = [2014, 10, 9, 17, 29]?>
	<?code d = date(*args)?>

is the same as::

	<?code d = date(2014, 10, 9, 17, 29)?>

The same can also be done with a keyword dictionary and the ``**`` syntax::

	<?code kwargs = {"day": 9, "month": 10, "year": 2014, "hour": 17: "minute": 29}?>
	<?code d = date(**kwargs)?>

Of course it's also possible to mix argument passing mechanics::

	<?code d = date(2014, *[10, 9], **{"hour": 17, "minute": 29})?>

or::

	<?code d = date(2014, month=10, day=9, **{'hour': 17, 'minute': 29})?>

However the ``*`` and ``**`` arguments can only be use at the end of the
argument list and positional arguments must always be before keyword arguments.

A list of builtin functions can be found in a later chapter.


Unary operators
"""""""""""""""

Arithmetic negation
+++++++++++++++++++

The unary operator ``-`` inverts the sign of its operand, which must be an
integer, float of boolean value::

	<?code x = 42?><?print -x?>

prints ``-42``. For ``-`` boolean values are treated as the numbers ``0`` and
``1``, i.e.::

	<?code x = True?><?print -x?>

prints ``-1``.


Binary negation
+++++++++++++++

The unary operator ``~`` inverts the bits of an integer or boolean value.
Non-negative numbers are interpreted as having an unlimited number of leading
``0`` bits and negative numbers are interpreted as having an unlimited number
of leading ``1`` bits. The means that ``~x`` will be negative if ``x`` is
non-negative and vice versa.


Multiplicative binary operators
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Multiplication
++++++++++++++

The multiplication operator ``*`` returns the arithmetic product of its
operands (which must be integer, float or boolean values). Furthermore it's
possible to multiply a sequence (i.e. a string or list) with a non-negative
integer to get a new sequences that repeats the items of the original sequence a
number of times, e.g. ``"foo" * 2`` returns ``"foofoo"`` and ``[1, 2, 3] * 3``
return ``[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]``. Multiplying with ``0`` returns an empty
string or list.

True division
+++++++++++++

The true division operator ``/`` returns the quotient of its operands (which
must be integer, float or boolean values). The result is always a float value.
``1/2`` returns ``0.5``.


Floor division
++++++++++++++

The float division operator ``//`` returns the quotient of its operands (which
must be integer, float or boolean values) rounded down to an integer. If any of
the operands is a float the result is a float too, otherwise it's an integer.

``1//2`` returns ``0``.


Modulo
++++++

The modulo operator ``%`` returns the remainder from the division of the first
operand by the second, e.g. ``15 % 7`` returns ``1``.


Additive binary operators
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Addition
++++++++

The addition operator ``+`` returns the sum of its operands (which must be
integer, float or boolean values). Furthermore sequences of the same type can be
added, so ``"foo" + "bar"`` returns ``"foobar"`` and ``[1, 2] + [3, 4]`` returns
``[1, 2, 3, 4]``.


Substraction
++++++++++++

The substraction operator ``-`` returns the difference of its operands (which
must be integer, float or boolean values).


Bit shift operators
"""""""""""""""""""

Binary left shift operator
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The binary left shift operator ``<<`` shifts the bits of its first operand (an
integer or boolean) to the left by the number of positions given by the second
operand (which must also be an integer or boolean).

Binary right shift operator
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The binary right shift operator ``>>`` shifts the bits of its first operand (an
integer or boolean) to the right by the number of positions given by the second
operand (which must also be an integer or boolean).


Binary bitwise and operator
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The bitwise and operator ``&`` returns the bitwise "and" combination of its
operands (which must be integer of boolean values). E.g. ``6 & 3`` returns ``2``.

As with the unary operator ``~``, negative numbers are interpreted as having an
unlimited number of leading ``1`` bits.


Binary bitwise exclusive or operator
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The bitwise exclusive or operator ``^`` returns the bitwise exclusive "or"
combination of its operands (which must be integer of boolean values).
E.g. ``6 ^ 3`` returns ``5``.

Negative numbers are again interpreted as having an unlimited number of leading
``1`` bits.


Binary bitwise inclusive or operator
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The bitwise inclusive or operator ``|`` returns the bitwise inclusive "or"
combination of its operands (which must be integer of boolean values).
E.g. ``6 | 3`` returns ``7``.

Negative numbers are again interpreted as having an unlimited number of leading
``1`` bits.


Binary comparison operators
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The comparison operators ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>`` and ``>=`` compare
the value of the two operands. ``==`` and ``!=`` support comparison of all
types of object. All others support comparison of "compatible" objects, which
means all "number" objects (integer, float and boolean) can be compared with
each other, all other objects can only be compared to objects of the same type.


Identify comparison operators
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The comparison operators ``is`` and ``is not`` test whether both operands refer
to the same object or not.

Note that the behaviour of these operators for "atomic" immutable objects
(like integers, floats and strings) is implementation defined.


Containment tests
"""""""""""""""""

The ``in`` operator
+++++++++++++++++++

The ``in`` operator tests whether the first operand is contained in the second
operand. In the expression ``a in b`` the following type combinations are
supported:

*	string, string: Checks whether ``a`` is a substring of ``b``.
*	any object, list: Checks whether the object ``a`` is in the list ``b``
	(comparison is done by value not by identity)
*	string, dict: Checks whether the key ``a`` is in the dictionary ``b``.
	(Note that some implementations might support keys other than strings too.
	E.g. Python and Java do, Javascript doesn't.)

The ``not in`` operator
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``not in`` operator returns the inverted result of the ``in`` operator, i.e.
it tests whether the first operand is not contained in the second operand.


Boolean negation
""""""""""""""""

The unary operator ``not`` inverts the truth value of its operand. I.e.
``not x`` is ``True`` for ``None``, ``False``, the undefined value, ``0``,
``0.0``, empty lists, strings, dictionaries and other empty container and
``False`` for everything else.


Boolean "and" operator
""""""""""""""""""""""

The binary operator ``and`` returns whether both of its operands are true.
It work like in Python by short-circuiting operand evaluation, i.e. if the
result is clear from the first operand the seconds won't be evaluated.

Furthermore ``and``  always return one of the operands.

So ``a and b`` first evaluates ``a``; if ``a`` is false, its value is returned;
otherwise, ``b`` is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.


Boolean "or" operator
"""""""""""""""""""""

The binary operator ``or`` returns whether any of its operands is true. Like
``and`` evaluation is short-circuited and one of the operands is returned.

For example, the following code will output the ``data.title`` object if it's
true, else ``data.id`` will be output::

	<?printx data.title or data.id?>


Conditional expressions
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The conditional expression (also called an "inline if") ``a if c else b`` first
evaluates the condition ``c``. If it is true ``a`` is evaluated and returned
else ``b`` is evaluated and returned.


Functions
---------

:mod:`ll.ul4c` supports a number of functions.


``now``
"""""""

``now()`` returns the current date and time as a date object.


``utcnow``
""""""""""

``utcnow()`` returns the current date and time as a date object in UTC.


``date``
""""""""

``date()`` creates a date object from the parameter passed in. ``date()``
supports from three parameters (``year``, ``month``, ``day``) upto seven
parameters (``year``, ``month``, ``day``, ``hour``, ``minute``, ``second``,
``microsecond``).


``timedelta``
"""""""""""""

``timedelta`` returns an object that represents a timespan. ``timedelta``
allows from zero to three arguments specifying the numbers of days, seconds and
microseconds. Passing negative values or values that are out of bounds (e.g.
24*60*60+1 seconds) is allowed. Arguments default to 0, i.e. ``timedelta()``
returns the timespan for "0 days, 0 seconds, 0 microseconds". In a boolean
context this object is treated as false (i.e. ``bool(timedelta()))`` returns
``False``). The following arithmetic operations are supported:

*	``date`` + ``timedelta``
*	``date`` - ``timedelta``
*	``timedelta`` + ``timedelta``
*	``timedelta`` - ``timedelta``
*	``number`` * ``timedelta``
*	``timedelta`` * ``number``
*	``timedelta`` / ``number``
*	``timedelta`` // ``int``


``monthdelta``
""""""""""""""

``monthdelta`` returns an object that represents a timespan of a number of
months. ``monthdelta`` allows zero or one arguments. With zero arguments
``monthdelta`` returns the timespan for "0 months". In a boolean context this
object is treated as false (i.e. ``bool(monthdelta()))`` or
``bool(monthdelta(0)))`` return ``False``). The following arithmetic operations
are supported:

*	``date`` + ``monthdelta``
*	``date`` - ``monthdelta``
*	``monthdelta`` + ``monthdelta``
*	``monthdelta`` - ``monthdelta``
*	``int`` * ``monthdelta``
*	``monthdelta`` // ``int``

For operations involving ``date`` objects, if the resulting day falls out of the
range of valid days for the target month, the last day for the target month
will be used instead, i.e. ``<?print @(2000-01-31) + monthdelta(1)?>`` prints
``2000-02-29 00:00:00``.

``update`` is a dictionary method. It supports an arbitrary number of positional
and keyword arguments. Each positional argument may be a dictionary, all the
items in the dictionary will be copied to the target dictionary. A positional
argument may also be an iterable of ``(key, value)`` pairs. These will also be
copied to the target dictionary. After each positional argument is copied over
in a last step the keyword arguments will be copied to the target dictionary.


``clear``
"""""""""

``clear`` is a dictionary and method. It makes the dictionary/set empty.


Templates as functions
======================

UL4 templates can be used as functions too. Calling a template as a function
will ignore any output from the template. The return value will be the value of
the first ``<?return?>`` tag encountered::

	from ll import ul4c

	code = """
		<?for item in data?>
			<?if "i" in item?>
				<?return item?>
			<?end if?>
		<?end for?>
	"""

	function = ul4c.Template(code)

	output = function(data=["Python", "Java", "Javascript", "PHP"]))

With this, ``output`` will be the string ``"Javascript"``.

When no ``<?return?>`` tag is encountered, ``None`` will be returned.

When a ``<?return?>`` tag is encountered when the template is used as a
template, output will simply stop and the return value will be ignored.


Exposing attributes
===================

It is possible to expose attributes of an object to UL4 templates. This is done
by setting the class attribute ``ul4attrs``::

	from ll import ul4c

	class Person:
		ul4attrs = {"firstname", "lastname"}

		def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, age):
			self.firstname = firstname
			self.lastname = lastname
			self.age = age

	p = Person("John", "Doe", 42)

	template = ul4c.Template("<?print p.lastname?>, <?print p.firstname?>")
	print(template.renders(p=p))

This will output ``Doe, John``.

Attributes not in ``ul4attrs`` will not be visible::

	template = ul4c.Template("<?print type(p.age)?>")
	print(template.renders(p=p))

This will output ``undefined``. Exposing attributes via ``ul4attrs`` also makes
it possible to use dictionary access to the object, i.e. iterating over the
object, using ``in`` and ``not in`` tests and using the methods ``items`` and
``values``.


Exposing methods
================

It is also possible to expose methods of an object to UL4 templates. This is
done by including the method name in the ``ul4attrs`` class attribute::

	from ll import ul4c

	class Person:
		ul4attrs = {"fullname"}

		def __init__(self, firstname, lastname):
			self.firstname = firstname
			self.lastname = lastname

		def fullname(self):
			return self.firstname + " " + self.lastname

	p = Person("John", "Doe")

	template = ul4c.Template("<?print p.fullname()?>")
	print(template.renders(p=p))

This will output ``John Doe``.

Furthermore it's possible to specify that the method needs access to the
rendering context (which stores the local variables and the UL4 call stack)::

	class Person:
		ul4attrs = {"fullname", "varcount"}

		@ul4c.withcontext
		def varcount(self):
			return len(context.vars)


Custom attributes
=================

To customize getting and setting object attributes from UL4 templates the
methods :meth:`ul4getattr` and :meth:`ul4setattr` can be implemented::

	from ll import ul4c

	class Person:
		ul4attrs = {"firstname", "lastname"}

		def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, age):
			self.firstname = firstname
			self.lastname = lastname
			self.age = age

		def ul4getattr(self, name):
			return getattr(self, name).upper()

	p = Person("John", "Doe", 42)

	template = ul4c.Template("<?print p.lastname?>, <?print p.firstname?>")
	print(template.renders(p=p))

This will output ``DOE, JOHN``.

If the object has an attribute ``ul4attrs`` :meth:`ul4getattr` will only be
called for the attributes in ``ul4attrs``, otherwise :meth:`ul4getattr` will
be called for all attributes (and should raise an :exc:`AttributeError` for
non-existant attributes)

Attributes can be made writable by implemention the method :meth:`ul4setattr`::

	from ll import ul4c

	class Person:
		ul4attrs = {"firstname", "lastname"}

		def __init__(self, firstname, lastname, age):
			self.firstname = firstname
			self.lastname = lastname
			self.age = age

		def ul4setattr(self, name, value):
			return setattr(self, name, value.upper())

	p = Person("John", "Doe", 42)

	template = ul4c.Template("<?code p.lastname = 'Doe'?><?print p.lastname?>, <?print p.firstname?>")
	print(template.renders(p=p))

This will output ``DOE, John``.

If the object has an attribute ``ul4attrs`` :meth:`ul4setattr` will only be
called for the attributes in ``ul4attrs``, otherwise :meth:`ul4setattr` will
be called for all attributes (and should raise an :exc:`AttributeError` for
non-existant or readonly attributes)

Without a :meth:`ul4setattr` method, attributes will never be made writable.


Exceptions
==========

Exception objects can not be created directly by UL4 templates, but UL4
templates can work with exceptions and access their attributes. The function
``isexception`` returns ``True`` is the argument is an exception object and
exception objects have an attribute ``cause`` that exposed the ``__cause__`` or
``__context__`` attribute of the Python exception object.

Exceptions that happen in UL4 templates use exception chaining to add
information about the location of the error while the exception bubbles up the
Python call stack. These exception objects have the following UL4 attributes:

``location``
	The AST node or tag where the error occured;

``template``
	The innermost template where the exception occurred (as a ``slice`` object);

``outerpos``
	The position of the tag where the error occurred (as a ``slice`` object);

``innerpos``
	The position of the AST node where the error occurred.

	If the error location is a tag (e.g. when there's an error with the block
	structure of the template), ``outerpos`` and ``innerpos`` are the same.


Delimiters
==========

It is possible to specify alternative delimiters for the template tags::

	>>> from ll import ul4c
	>>> t = ul4c.Template(
	... 	"{{for i in range(10)}}{{print i}};{{end for}}",
	... 	startdelim="{{",
	... 	enddelim="}}"
	... )
	>>> t.renders()
	'0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;'


Whitespace
==========

Normally the literal text between template tags will be output as it is. This
behaviour can be changed by passing a different value to the ``whitespace``
parameter in the constructor. The possible values are:

``"keep"``
	The default behaviour: literal text will be output as it is.

``"strip"``
	Linefeeds and the following indentation in literal text will be ignored::

		>>> from ll import ul4c
		>>> t = ul4c.Template("""
		... 	<?for i in range(10)?>
		... 		<?print i?>
		... 		;
		... 	<?end for?>
		... """, whitespace="strip")
		>>> t.renders()
		'0;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;'

	However trailing whitespace at the end of the line will still be honored.

``"smart"``
	If a line contains only indentation and one tag that isn't a ``print``,
	``printx`` or ``render`` tag, the indentation and the linefeed after the tag
	will be stripped from the text. Furthermore the additional indentation that
	might be introduced by a ``for``, ``if``, ``elif``, ``else`` or ``def``
	block will be ignored. So for example the output of::

		<?code langs = ["Python", "Java", "Javascript"]?>
		<?if langs?>
			<?for lang in langs?>
				<?print lang?>
			<?end for?>
		<?end if?>

	will simply be::

		Python
		Java
		Javascript

	without any additional empty lines or indentation.

	Rendering a template ``B`` inside an template ``A`` will reindent the output
	of ``B`` to the indentation level of the ``<?render?>`` tag in the template
	``A``.

It is also possible to specify the whitespace behaviour in the template itself
with the ``<?whitespace?>`` tag, so::

	<?whitespace smart?>

anywhere in the template source will switch on smart whitespace handling.

A ``<?whitespace?>`` tag overwrites the ``whitespace`` parameter specified
in the constructor.
