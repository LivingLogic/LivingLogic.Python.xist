Hi all!

What's new?

See the CHANGES file


What is it?
-----------

XIST is an XML based extensible HTML generator.
Some of the significant features of XIST include:

   * Easily extensible with new XML elements
   * Can be used for offline or online page generation
   * Allows embedding Python code in XML files
   * Works together with httpdapy/mod_python/PyWX
   * Simplifies handling of deeply nested directory trees
   * Automatically generates HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes for images

It was written as a replacement for the HTML preprocessor HSC
(http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/hsc/), and borrows some features and
ideas from it.

It also borrows the basic ideas (XML/HTML elements as Python objects)
from HTMLgen or HyperText.


Where can I get it?
