Hi all!

What's new?
-----------
* XIST now uses sgmlop directly, so it doesn't require xmllib anymore
  and works with PyXML-0.5.4
* A new example that generates XML documentation from Python modules,
  so you can write your Python docstrings in XML. Note that this isn't
  finished yet, and should be considered work in progress.
* XIST now provides line number information in repr dumps and exceptions,
  which greatly simplifies finding error in XML files.
* Various enhancements and bugfixes.


What is it?
-----------

XIST is a HTML preprocessor/generator and an XML transformation engine.
Some of the significant features of XIST include:

   * Easily extensible with new XML elements
   * Can be used for offline or online page generation
   * Allows embedding Python code in XML files
   * Works together with httpdapy/mod_python/PyWX
   * Simplifies handling of deeply nested directory trees
   * Automatically generates HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes for images

It was written as a replacement for the HTML preprocessor HSC
(http://www.giga.or.at/~agi/hsc/), and borrows some features and
ideas from it.

It also borrows the basic ideas (XML/HTML elements as Python objects)
from HTMLgen or HyperText.


Where can I get it?
-------------------

XIST is available from ftp://titan.bnbt.de/pub/livinglogic/xist/.
