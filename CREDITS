The following people were essential for the design and
development of XIST:

Guido van Rossum - for inventing a programming language
	where programming is fun again.

Fredrik Lundh - parsing is a dirty job, but somebody's gotta
	do it. ;)

Thomas Aglassinger - for hsc, which started it all.

Hartmut Goebel - for testing, sending comments, bugfixes
	and patches, and for the idea and first implementation
	of cond.py.

Neelakantan Krishnaswami - for Signature.py, which is used
	in the doc example.
