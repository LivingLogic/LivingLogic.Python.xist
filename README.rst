XIST is an extensible HTML and XML generator written in Python and also
a DOM parser (built on top of SAX2) with a very simple and pythonesque
tree API. Every XML element type corresponds to a Python class and these
Python classes provide a conversion method to transform the XML tree
(e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered object oriented XSLT.
