ToDos and stupid ideas
======================

Real namespace support.

Implement new relative URLs as a new scheme:
	roots://foo/bar.html
and define the meaning of foo somewhere.

Cache parsed XML files and image sizes.

findPos() that works like find(), but returns a list
of position index lists (i.e. "DOM paths").

findFirst() which only finds the first occurrence.

Local variables inside processing instructions
as a dictionary.

Have html.head.convert() automatically create a
meta.contenttype if none is present.
