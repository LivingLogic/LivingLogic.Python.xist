ToDos and stupid ideas
======================

Implement new project relative URLs as a new scheme:
	*/foo.html => root://foo.html
	*foo/bar.html => roots://foo/bar.html

Fix the problem that URL constructor arguments are ambigous,
does query=None mean "no argument given" or does it mean
"clear the query attribute"?

Make URLs much more object oriented (one class for every scheme?)

Cache parsed XML files and image sizes.

Allow different parsers to be used, not just sgmlop.

findPos() that works like find(), but returns a list
of position index lists (i.e. "DOM paths").

Split parsers, providers and nested namespaces into
separate classes.

Local variables inside processing instructions
as a dictionary.

parse() und parseString() as global functions
that get passed a parser/provider/nestednamespace
(or create one if none is passed).

Have html.head.convert() automatically create a
meta.contenttype if none is present.
