ToDos and stupid ideas
======================

Unify Filename and URL.

URL("/gurk/", scheme="file") does not work.

Real namespace support.

Implement new relative URLs as a new scheme:
	roots://foo/bar.html
and define the meaning of foo somewhere.

Fix the problem that URL constructor arguments are ambigous,
does query=None mean "no argument given" or does it mean
"clear the query attribute"?

Make URLs much more object oriented (one class for every scheme?)

Cache parsed XML files and image sizes.

findPos() that works like find(), but returns a list
of position index lists (i.e. "DOM paths").

findFirst() which only finds the first occurrence.

Local variables inside processing instructions
as a dictionary.

Have html.head.convert() automatically create a
meta.contenttype if none is present.
