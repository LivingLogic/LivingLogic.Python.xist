identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that
devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become
feasible for expressing local structure in the source language.

Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a

&quot;Python tricks&quot; is a tough one, cuz the language is so clean.  E.g., C

I've seen Python criticized as &quot;ugly&quot; precisely because it <em>doesn't</em> have

I don't know a lot about this artificial life stuff

Nevertheless in wondering why free software is so good these days
it occurred to me that the propagation of free software is one gigantic
artificial life evolution experiment, but the metaphor isn't perfect.
<br>
Programs are thrown out into the harsh environment, and the bad ones
die. The good ones adapt rapidly and become very robust in short
order.
<br>
The only problem with the metaphor is that the process isn't random
at all. Python <em>chooses</em> to include Tk's genes; Linux decides
to make itself more suitable for symbiosis with X, etcetera.

The larger scientific computing centers generally have a &quot;theory&quot;
division and a &quot;actually uses the computer&quot; &lt;wink&gt; division.  The
theory division generally boasts some excellent theoreticians and

physical scientists who simply want to get their work done.  In most
labs I've seen, the two divisions hate each others' guts (or, rarely,
blissfully ignore each other), &amp; the politics is so thick you float on

In one particular way the conflict is fundamental &amp; eternal: the

Notes:
<br>
     (1) Many of you many not be aware of the fabulously successful
'Guido for President' Campaign. While Guido has no interest in being the
president, the PSA thought it would be a cool way to collect money. The
centerpiece of the campaign featured an attractive offer to spend the
night in Guido's spare bedroom in exchange for a $50,000.00
contribution. (Mark Lutz stayed TWICE!)
<br>
     (2) Since the proliferation of Monty Python related names (Python,
Monty, Grail, Eric-the-Half-a-Compiler, et al.) has increased over the
past year, the PSA felt it would be wise to licencing the Python name to
forestall any lawsuits. An added benefit is that John Cleese is teaching
Guido how to walk funny.
<br>
     (3) Pre-Release vacations are spent in the Catskills. Post-Release
vacations are spent in the Bahamas. Guido is currently working on a
system which will allow him to make more releases of Python; thus
octupling the number of vacations he takes in a year.

Every standard applies to a certain problem domain and a certain level. A
standard can work perfectly and save the world economy billions of dollars
and there will still be software and hardware compatibility problems.
In fact, solving one level of compatibility just gives rise to the next
level of incompatibility. For example, connecting computers together through
standard protocols gives rise to the problem of byte endianness issues.
Solving byte endianness gives rise to the problem of character sets.
Solving character sets gives rise to the problem of end-of-line and
end-of-file conventions. Solving that gets us to the problem of
interpreting the low-level syntax (thus XML). Then we need to interpet
that syntax in terms of objects and properties (thus RDF, WDDX, etc.). And

Contrary to advertising, no parsing system is &quot;easy to learn&quot;, in or out of
the Python world -- parsing is a hard problem.  Most are easy enough to use
after practice, though.  Ironically, the trickiest system of all to master
(regexps) is also the feeblest and the most widely used.

So Python's only cross-platform choices were to
mimic the C/POSIX API or invent its own new x-platform API; only one of
those is realistic (as Java proves every day &lt;wink&gt;).

I expect that what you really object to is the absence
of control structures other than goto, and the LT/GE/etc spelling of
comparison operators.  That was common enough in its day, and even by the
time Pascal came around the keypunch I used still didn't have a semicolon
key.  It looks ugly in retrospect only because it is &lt;wink&gt;.
