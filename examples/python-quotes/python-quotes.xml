We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are
identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that
devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become
feasible for expressing local structure in the source language.

Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a
good idea it takes about 1 minute and five lines to program something
that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend
the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you
want.

"Python tricks" is a tough one, cuz the language is so clean.  E.g., C
makes an art of confusing pointers with arrays and strings, which leads
to lotsa neat pointer tricks; APL mistakes everything for an array,
leading to neat one-liners; and Perl confuses everything period, making
each line a joyous adventure &lt;wink&gt;.

I've seen Python criticized as "ugly" precisely because it <em>doesn't</em> have
a trick-based view of the world.  In many ways, it's a dull language,
borrowing solid old concepts from many other languages &amp; styles:  boring
syntax, unsurprising semantics, few automatic coercions, etc etc.  But
that's one of the things I like about it.

Note that because of its semantics, 'del' <em>can't</em> be a function: "del

I don't know a lot about this artificial life stuff
-- but I'm suspicious of anything Newsweek gets goofy about
-- and I suspect its primary use is as another money extraction tool
to be applied by ai labs to the department of defense
(and more power to 'em).
<br/>
Nevertheless in wondering why free software is so good these days
it occurred to me that the propagation of free software is one gigantic
artificial life evolution experiment, but the metaphor isn't perfect.
<br/>
Programs are thrown out into the harsh environment, and the bad ones
die. The good ones adapt rapidly and become very robust in short
order.
<br/>
The only problem with the metaphor is that the process isn't random
at all. Python <em>chooses</em> to include Tk's genes; Linux decides
to make itself more suitable for symbiosis with X, etcetera. 
<br/>
Free software is artificial life, but better.

Ehh, the poor old man's name is Dijkstra.  I should know, "ij" is a

obvious: his famous "P and V" names for semaphores are derived for the
Dutch words "Passeer" and "Verlaat", or "Pass" and "Leave".  And no, I
haven't met him (although he did work at CWI back in the fifties when
it was called, as it should still be today, Mathematical Centre).  he

The larger scientific computing centers generally have a "theory"
division and a "actually uses the computer" &lt;wink&gt; division.  The
theory division generally boasts some excellent theoreticians and
designers, while the other division generally boasts some excellent
physical scientists who simply want to get their work done.  In most
labs I've seen, the two divisions hate each others' guts (or, rarely,
blissfully ignore each other), &amp; the politics is so thick you float on
it even after they embed your feet in cement blocks (hence even the
simple relief of death is denied you &lt;wink&gt;).

In one particular way the conflict is fundamental &amp; eternal: the
"working scientists" generally understand the hardware du jour
perfectly, and passionately resent any attempt to prevent them from
fiddling with it directly -- while the theory folks are forever
inventing new ways to hide the hardware du jour.  That two groups can
both be so right and so wrong at the same time is my seventh proof for

Notes:
<br/>
     (1) Many of you many not be aware of the fabulously successful
'Guido for President' Campaign. While Guido has no interest in being the
president, the PSA thought it would be a cool way to collect money. The
centerpiece of the campaign featured an attractive offer to spend the
night in Guido's spare bedroom in exchange for a $50,000.00
contribution. (Mark Lutz stayed TWICE!)
<br/>
     (2) Since the proliferation of Monty Python related names (Python,
Monty, Grail, Eric-the-Half-a-Compiler, et al.) has increased over the
past year, the PSA felt it would be wise to licencing the Python name to
forestall any lawsuits. An added benefit is that John Cleese is teaching
Guido how to walk funny.
<br/>
     (3) Pre-Release vacations are spent in the Catskills. Post-Release
vacations are spent in the Bahamas. Guido is currently working on a
system which will allow him to make more releases of Python; thus
octupling the number of vacations he takes in a year.

Every language has its partisans, usually among folks deeply immersed in
their particular theology, triumphant in having divined the inner meaning of
some esoteric operations, like a medieval Jesuit hot on the trail of the
final ontological proof,  whose conciseness in solving a single problem
makes them almost swoon with ecstacy at the expected savings of many
keystrokes, as if those very keystrokes represented a lot of heavy lifting
and hauling on their part.

The problem I have with "SETL sets" in Python is the same I have with every
other language's "killer core" in Python:  SETL is much more than just "a
set type", Eiffel is much more than just fancy pre- and post-conditions,
Perl's approach to regexps is much more than just its isolated regexp
syntax, Scheme is much more than just first-class functions &amp; lexical
closures, and so on.  Good languages aren't random collections of
interchangeable features:  they have a philosophy and internal coherence
that's never profitably confused with their surface features.

I believe sometimes numbers
creep into my programs as strings, so '4'/2 needs to also be 2.
Other languages do this.  Since this is due in part to user input,
I guess 'four'/2, 'quattro/2', 'iv/2' etc. need to be 2 as well;
don't know any other language that does so, but Python could take the
lead here in software reliability.  Any white space should be ignored,
including between my ears.  I don't have time to write any useful
software, so I've decided to devote myself to proposing various
changes to the Python interpreter.

Anyone else know what a Stanley #45 plane is? ... it's not
what you use if you aren't looking to produce intricate moldings.  If
you want to make a tabletop flat, and bring out the natural beauty of
the wood, you use a big, long and flat bench plane.  The beauty is in
the wood, not the tool, the tool is just the right one to let you see
that and to let others see it too.

<br/>

And that's a very impressive kind of beauty in itself, isn't it?  The
kind of beauty some say is homely--an uninteresting face, boring angles,
few if any parts, no curly flowers.  It's just a tool, and not beautiful
at all.  But look, that tool makes beauty.  It makes it *easy* to make
beautiful things, to see deep into the the grain of whatever material

Every standard applies to a certain problem domain and a certain level. A
standard can work perfectly and save the world economy billions of dollars
and there will still be software and hardware compatibility problems.
In fact, solving one level of compatibility just gives rise to the next
level of incompatibility. For example, connecting computers together through
standard protocols gives rise to the problem of byte endianness issues.
Solving byte endianness gives rise to the problem of character sets.
Solving character sets gives rise to the problem of end-of-line and
end-of-file conventions. Solving that gets us to the problem of
interpreting the low-level syntax (thus XML). Then we need to interpet
that syntax in terms of objects and properties (thus RDF, WDDX, etc.). And
so forth.

We could judge a standard's success by its ability to reveal another level
of standardization that is necessary.

Programming is no different - it's only by going outside what you know, and
looking from another direction (working, if you like, your brain, so that
it can be more powerful :-) that you can improve further.

Contrary to advertising, no parsing system is "easy to learn", in or out of
the Python world -- parsing is a hard problem.  Most are easy enough to use
after practice, though.  Ironically, the trickiest system of all to master
(regexps) is also the feeblest and the most widely used.

So Python's only cross-platform choices were to
mimic the C/POSIX API or invent its own new x-platform API; only one of
those is realistic (as Java proves every day &lt;wink&gt;).

Yes:  the code in ntpath.split is too clever to have any hope of working

But it's a general way to debug: tell someone what right things
your program is doing. Chances are that you will see the wrong
thing(s) before the other person has said anything...
I just stick a picture of a face on my monitor and talk to
it to find bugs.

Might just be nostalgia, but I think I would give an arm

    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

    Errors should never pass silently.

    Unless explicitly silenced.

    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

    Now is better than never.

    Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.

    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Sorry for the term, I picked it up from Jim Fulton back when it was
an about-to-be-added feature for Principia/Aqueduct.  As with so many
Fultonisms, it's vivid and tends to stick in one's (non-pluggable) brain.
