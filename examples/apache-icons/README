This example shows several things:

1) Using the URL stack for relative URLs

2) using the XHTML argument with the asString()
   function

3) automatic generation of height and width
   attributes for images

What it does is generate a page with all the
pictures found in http://localhost/icons/.
To use the script as it is, you have to copy
index.py and icons.css to http://localhost/icons/
and configure Apache to execute index.py as a CGI script.
