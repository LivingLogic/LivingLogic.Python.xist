This example shows several things:

1) How to use XIST with httpdapi

2) Using the URL stack for relative URLs

3) using the XHTML argument with the asString()
   function
   
4) automatic generation of height and width
   attributes for images
   
What it does is generate a page with all the
pictures found in http://localhost/icons/.
To use the script as it is, you have to copy
index.py and icons.css to http://localhost/icons/,
install httpdapi and configure Apache to execute
index.py via httpdapi.
