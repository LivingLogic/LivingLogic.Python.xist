New in 0.3.4
------------

Location information is now copied over in clone(), asHTML() and compact() where approrpiate,
so you know even in the HTML tree, where something came from.

xsc.repransi can now have three values:
	0 coloring is off
	1 coloring is on for a dark background
	2 coloring is on for a light background
All repransi* variables are now arrays with two strings, the first for dark, the second for
light.
