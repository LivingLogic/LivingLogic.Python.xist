----------
The documentation expample has been enhanced. Now documenting methods works.

When the member "elementname" in the element class is set before calling
registerElement(), this element name will be used for the element. This
allows custom name even when used registerAllElements().

Comparison of scheme and server in URLs is done case insensitive (as RFC 2068
requires.)

New in 0.3.4
------------

Location information is now copied over in clone(), asHTML() and compact() where appropriate,
so you know even in the HTML tree, where something came from.

xsc.repransi can now have three values:
	0 coloring is off
	1 coloring is on for a dark background
	2 coloring is on for a light background
All repransi* variables are now arrays with two strings, the first for dark, the second for
light.

New in 0.3.3
------------

The workaround for the trailing cdata bug in sgmlop has been removed, so now you'll need
a newer version of sgmlop (included in PyXML 0.5.5.1)
