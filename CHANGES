New in 0.4
----------
There an additional publisher class FilePublisher, which can
be used for publishing to a file (or anything else that has
a write method).

Element- and attributenames are no longer converted to lowercase.
If you have an attribute name which clashes with a Python
keyword (e.g. "class") append an underscore (_), which will be
removed before accessing the attribute. This is the "official"
Python method for handling these cases.

Elements and entities are no longer registered one by one. Now
you can build Namespace objects which are used for searching.
For more info, see the source.

Image size calculation has been removed from html.img and html.input.
Use specials.autoimg and specials.autoinput for that.

{Frag,Element}.__{set,get,del}item__ now accept a list as an argument.
The method will be applied recursively, i.e. e[[0,1,"foo",2] is the
same e[0][1]["foo"][2].

New in 0.3.9
------------
sgmlop will now be found either via
	import sgmlop
or via
	from xml.parsers import sgmlop

New in 0.3.8
------------
Fixed a bug in URLAttr.publish, which prevented URLAttr from working
at all.

New in 0.3.7
------------
Fixed a bug in html.img and html.input. Now image size calculation works
again.

New in 0.3.6
------------
Fixed a bug in Node._matches, which resulted in a non working
find().

New in 0.3.5
------------
The documentation example has been enhanced. Now documenting methods works.

When the member "elementname" in the element class is set before calling
registerElement(), this element name will be used for the element. This
allows customs name even when used registerAllElements().

Comparison of scheme and server in URLs is done case insensitive (as RFC 2068
requires.)

Image size calculation is now done in asString() and not in asHTML(). This allows
to write faster code:
	Old method: e = html.div(html.img(...),gurk.hurz()).asHTML().asString()
	New method: e = html.div(html.img(...),gurk.hurz().asHTML()).asString()

Image size calculation is now done for <input type="image">. The "size" attribute
is set to the image width.

Manipulating the path in an URL is now done via the usual __setitem__/__getitem__ stuff,
which keeps the path in a consistent state.
>>> from xist.URL import URL
>>> u = URL("/foo/*/../bar/baz.gif")
>>> del u[1]
>>> u
URL(scheme='server', path=['bar'], file='baz', ext='gif')

findNodes() (which has been shortened to find()) has an additional argument test, which can
be a test function that will be called when the node passes all other tests.

asString() no longer generates a string directly, but uses the new method publish, which
has an additional argument publisher, to which the strings to be output are passed.

New in 0.3.4
------------
Location information is now copied over in clone(), asHTML() and compact() where appropriate,
so you know even in the HTML tree, where something came from.

xsc.repransi can now have three values:
	0 coloring is off
	1 coloring is on for a dark background
	2 coloring is on for a light background
All repransi* variables are now arrays with two strings, the first for dark, the second for
light.


New in 0.3.3
------------
The workaround for the trailing cdata bug in sgmlop has been removed, so now you'll need
a newer version of sgmlop (included in PyXML 0.5.5.1)
