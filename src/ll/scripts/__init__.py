This package contains the following scripts:

	allow system commands and database access. Supported databases are Oracle,
	SQLite, MySQL and Redis.

:program:`uls`
	:program:`uls` is an URL-enabled version of the :command:`ls` command for
	listing directory content. It uses :mod:`ll.url` and supports ``ssh`` and
	``oracle`` URLs (via :mod:`ll.orasql`).

:program:`ucp`
	:program:`ucp` is an URL-enabled version of the :command:`cp` command for
	copying files (and file-like objects). It supports ``ssh`` and ``oracle``
	URLs for both source and target files.

:program:`ucat`
	:program:`ucat` is an URL-enabled version of the :command:`cat` command for
	printing files (and file-like objects).
