		allow system commands and database access. Supported databases are Oracle,
		SQLite and MySQL.

		``uls`` is an URL-enabled version of the ``ls`` command for listing
		directory content. It uses :mod:`ll.url` and supports ``ssh`` and
		``oracle`` URLs (via :mod:`ll.orasql`).

	``ucp``
		``ucp`` is an URL-enabled version of the ``cp`` command for copying files
		(and file-like objects). It supports ``ssh`` and ``oracle`` URLs for both
		source and target files.

		``ucat`` is an URL-enabled version of the ``cat`` command for printing
		files (and file-like objects).
