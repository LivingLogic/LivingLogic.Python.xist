:mod:`ll.xpit` contains functions that make it possible to embed Python
expressions and conditionals in text. For example::

	from ll import xpit

	text = '''
	a = <?= a?>
	b = <?= b?>
	The sum is <?= a+b?>
	<?if a>0?>a is positive<?elif a==0?>a is 0<?else?>a is negative<?endif?>
	'''

	print xpit.convert(text, dict(a=23, b=42))

This will print::

	a = 23
	b = 42
	The sum is 65
	a is positive

	the output. All these PIs will have :var:`globals` as the global and
