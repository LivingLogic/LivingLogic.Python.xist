"""
XIST is an extensible HTML and XML generator. XIST is also a XML parser with a
very simple and pythonesque tree API. Every XML element type corresponds to a
Python class and these Python classes provide a conversion method to transform
the XML tree (e.g. into HTML). XIST can be considered 'object oriented XSLT'.

XIST was written as a replacement for the HTML preprocessor HSC__, and borrows
some features and ideas from it.

__ http://www.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/~msbethke/software.html

It also borrows the basic ideas (XML/HTML elements as Python objects) from
HTMLgen_ and HyperText_.
