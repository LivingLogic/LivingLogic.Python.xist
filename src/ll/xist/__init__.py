"""
<p>&xist; is an extensible &html; and &xml; generator written in Python.
&xist; is also a &dom; parser (built on top of &sax;2) with a very simple and
pythonesque tree &api;. Every &xml; element type corresponds to a Python class and these
Python classes provide a conversion method to transform the &xml; tree (e.g. into
&html;). &xist; can be considered <z>object oriented &xslt;</z>.</p>

<p>Some of the significant features of &xist; include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily extensible with new &xml; elements,</li>
<li>Can be used for offline or online page generation,</li>
<li>Allows embedding Python code in &xml; files,</li>
<li>Supports separation of layout and logic,</li>
<li>Can be used together with <a href="http://www.modpython.org/">mod_python</a>,
<a href="http://pywx.idyll.org/">PyWX</a> or <a href="http://webware.sf.net/">Webware</a>
to generate dynamic pages,</li>
<li>Fully supports Unicode and &xml; namespaces,</li>
<li>Provides features to use &xist; together with &jsp;/Struts (when replacing
Struts tag libraries with &xist; this speeds up pages by a factor of 5&ndash;10.)</li>
</ul>

<p>&xist; was written as a replacement for the
<a href="http://www.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/~msbethke/software.html">&html; preprocessor &hsc;</a>,
and borrows some features and ideas from it.</p>

<p>It also borrows the basic ideas (&xml;/&html; elements as Python
objects) from
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/friedrich/HTMLgen/html/main.html">HTMLgen</a>
and <a href="http://dustman.net/andy/python/HyperText/">HyperText</a>.</p>
