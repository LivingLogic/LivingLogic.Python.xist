      We will perhaps eventually be writing only small modules which are
      identified by name as they are used to build larger ones, so that
      devices like indentation, rather than delimiters, might become
      feasible for expressing local structure in the source language.

      Frankly, I'd rather not try to compete with Perl in the areas where
      Perl is best -- it's a battle that's impossible to win, and I don't

      and shortcuts that Perl has acquired through the years.

      Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a
      good idea it takes about 1 minute and five lines to program something
      that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend
      the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you
      want.

      "Python tricks" is a tough one, cuz the language is so clean. E.g., C
      makes an art of confusing pointers with arrays and strings, which
      leads to lotsa neat pointer tricks; APL mistakes everything for an
      array, leading to neat one-liners; and Perl confuses everything
      period, making each line a joyous adventure &lt;wink&gt;.

      I've seen Python criticized as "ugly" precisely because it
      <em>doesn't</em> have a trick-based view of the world. In many ways,
      it's a dull language, borrowing solid old concepts from many other
      languages &amp; styles: boring syntax, unsurprising semantics, few
      automatic coercions, etc etc. But that's one of the things I like
      about it.

      Note that because of its semantics, 'del' <em>can't</em> be a
      function: "del a" deletes 'a' from the current namespace. A function
      can't delete something from the calling namespace (except when written
      by Steve Majewski :-).

      I don't know a lot about this artificial life stuff -- but I'm
      suspicious of anything Newsweek gets goofy about -- and I suspect its
      primary use is as another money extraction tool to be applied by ai
      labs to the department of defense (and more power to 'em).

      Nevertheless in wondering why free software is so good these days it
      occurred to me that the propagation of free software is one gigantic
      artificial life evolution experiment, but the metaphor isn't perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programs are thrown out into the harsh environment, and the bad ones
      die. The good ones adapt rapidly and become very robust in short
      order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only problem with the metaphor is that the process isn't random at
      all. Python <em>chooses</em> to include Tk's genes; Linux decides to
      make itself more suitable for symbiosis with X, etcetera.

      [After someone wrote "...assignment capability, a la djikstra"] Ehh,
      the poor old man's name is Dijkstra. I should know, "ij" is a well
      known digraph in the Dutch language. And before someone asks the
      obvious: his famous "P and V" names for semaphores are derived for the
      Dutch words "Passeer" and "Verlaat", or "Pass" and "Leave". And no, I
      haven't met him (although he did work at CWI back in the fifties when
      it was called, as it should still be today, Mathematical Centre). he
      currently lives in Austin, Texas I believe. (While we're at it... does
      anybody remember the Dijkstra font for Macintoshes? It was a scanned
      version of his handwriting. I believe Luca Cardelli scanned it -- the

      Modula-3. I could go on forever... :-)

      The larger scientific computing centers generally have a "theory"
      division and a "actually uses the computer" &lt;wink&gt; division. The
      theory division generally boasts some excellent theoreticians and
      designers, while the other division generally boasts some excellent
      physical scientists who simply want to get their work done. In most
      labs I've seen, the two divisions hate each others' guts (or, rarely,
      blissfully ignore each other), &amp; the politics is so thick you
      float on it even after they embed your feet in cement blocks (hence
      even the simple relief of death is denied you &lt;wink&gt;).

      In one particular way the conflict is fundamental &amp; eternal: the
      "working scientists" generally understand the hardware du jour
      perfectly, and passionately resent any attempt to prevent them from
      fiddling with it directly -- while the theory folks are forever
      inventing new ways to hide the hardware du jour. That two groups can
      both be so right and so wrong at the same time is my seventh proof for
      the existence of God ...

    <p>Notes:</p>
    <p>
      (1) Many of you many not be aware of the fabulously successful 'Guido
      for President' Campaign. While Guido has no interest in being the
      president, the PSA thought it would be a cool way to collect money.
      The centerpiece of the campaign featured an attractive offer to spend
      the night in Guido's spare bedroom in exchange for a $50,000.00
      contribution. (Mark Lutz stayed TWICE!)
    </p>
    <p>
      (2) Since the proliferation of Monty Python related names (Python,
      Monty, Grail, Eric-the-Half-a-Compiler, et al.) has increased over the
      past year, the PSA felt it would be wise to licencing the Python name
      to forestall any lawsuits. An added benefit is that John Cleese is
      teaching Guido how to walk funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      (3) Pre-Release vacations are spent in the Catskills. Post-Release
      vacations are spent in the Bahamas. Guido is currently working on a
      system which will allow him to make more releases of Python; thus
      octupling the number of vacations he takes in a year.

      One of my first big programming assignments as a student of computer

      It succeeded perhaps too well. For a long time, I was convinced that
      source code formatters were a total waste of time, and decided to
      write beautiful code that no automatic formatter could improve upon.

      1) Claim that Python can't do a &lt;some random combination of 'L',

      Every standard applies to a certain problem domain and a certain
      level. A standard can work perfectly and save the world economy
      billions of dollars and there will still be software and hardware
      compatibility problems. In fact, solving one level of compatibility
      just gives rise to the next level of incompatibility. For example,
      connecting computers together through standard protocols gives rise to
      the problem of byte endianness issues. Solving byte endianness gives
      rise to the problem of character sets. Solving character sets gives
      rise to the problem of end-of-line and end-of-file conventions.
      Solving that gets us to the problem of interpreting the low-level
      syntax (thus XML). Then we need to interpet that syntax in terms of
      objects and properties (thus RDF, WDDX, etc.). And so forth.

      See, functional programmers are an insular lot. You rarely see them in
      public, except at parades when they all have antler- hats and silly
      shoes on. So they completely missed the infamous "goto considered
      harmful" thread and didn't even realize they were doing anything
      wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, let's pretend you're writing a 'bot that can pass as a functional
      programmer. There's a complex protocol here. When two functional
      programmers see each other on the street, they recognize each other by
      the antler hats. But in certain parts of the Midwest, regular people
      wear antler hats, too. So there's a protocol. First a &lt;wink
      wink&gt;. Then the secret handshake. Then you sniff each other's
      armpits and stamp your foot 3 times.
    </p>
    <p>
      OK, so you've written a bot, and it works fine on the street. Now you
      send it to a cocktail party. It sees a potential functional programmer
      and gives the &lt;wink wink&gt;. Now it tries to move into position to
      do the secret handshake, but discovers that it's antler-hat is
      entangled with someone else's. Oops. &lt;wink wink&gt; at the new guy.
      Handshake. But before it can sniff, the first one has moved up for his
      handshake. Ay yi yi. Your bot crashes and is exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now you rewrite your bot to use a finite state machine so it can
      handle multiple sessions. That means throwing out all the code that
      worked on the street. But if you'd used continuations, it would be a
      relatively minor adjustment of that code. 'Course you wouldn't have
      had to write the bot to begin with.

      When explaining programming I sometimes compare programmers to

      they are keen to argue the merits of their favorite tools.
      Professional photographers talk about contrast and lighting and
      composition. The camera is almost irrelevant. Ansel Adams used cameras
      that were less sophisticated than a supermarket disposable, back when
      photography was slow and tedious (like batch-oriented programming).
      Because the technology was so primitive, he carefully planned his

      The static people talk about rigorously enforced interfaces,

      rigorously enforced testing and say that types only catch a small
      portion of possible errors. The static people retort that they don't
      trust tests to cover everything or not have bugs and why write tests
      for stuff the compiler should test for you, so you shouldn't rely on
      <em>only</em> tests, and besides static types don't catch a small
      portion, but a large portion of errors. The dynamic people say no
      program or test is perfect and static typing is not worth the cost in
      language complexity and design difficulty for the gain in eliminating
      a few tests that would have been easy to write anyway, since static
      types catch a small portion of errors, not a large portion. The static
      people say static types don't add that much language complexity, and
      it's not design "difficulty" but an essential part of the process, and
      they catch a large portion, not a small portion. The dynamic people
      say they add enormous complexity, and they catch a small portion, and
      point out that the static people have bad breath. The static people
