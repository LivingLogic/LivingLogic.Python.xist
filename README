XIST v0.1

This is a HTML generator/XML transformation engine/web publishing system
written in Python and based on the Python XML package.

For documentation read xist/xsc.py.

The only requirements for installing the package are Python 1.5.2 or
later, a version of the Python XML package that includes xmllib and the
Python Imaging Library. It's recommended that you have the Distutils
installed; fetch the latest version from
http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/.

To compile everything, simply perform the following steps.

1) Run "python setup.py build" to copy *.py files.

2) To install everything in the site-packages directory as a xist/ package,
   run "python setup.py install".

If you have difficulty installing this software, send a problem report
to Walter Dörwald <walter@bnbt.de> describing the problem.
